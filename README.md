# Robin Cleaner

This bookmarklet adds useful commands to Robin chat rooms. As the rooms grow in size the volume of spam increases dramatically.  This bookmarklet will let you mute spammy messages or users and, hopefully, render even the biggest rooms usable. To install, drag this link to your bookmarks bar: <a href="javascript: alert('Woo!');">Robin Cleaner</a>

After clicking and running this bookmarklet on a Robin chat room you'll have access to two new slash commands to limit spam: `/muteMessage` and `/muteUser`.

You'll also be able to clear your mute list with `/clearMute`, to clear everything `/clearMuteMessage`, to clear just the messages you've muted, and `/clearMuteUser`, to clear just the users you've muted.
